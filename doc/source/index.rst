   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

==================================
Welcome to pypet's documentation!
==================================

The new python parameter exploration toolbox. *pypet* manages exploration of the parameter space and
data storage for you. Currently supported storage is HDF5!

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   introduction
   cookbook
   examples
   code

============================
Requirements
============================

pandas >= 0.12.0
numpy >= 1.5.0
tables >= 3.0.0

Before the official release of version 0.1.0
I will include support for PyTables 2.X.
So you won't have the hassle with manually updating your
tables package!

--------------------------------
Tests
--------------------------------

Test can be found in pypet.tests.
Note that they involve heavy file IO and it might not be the case
that you have privileges on your system to write files to the particular folder.
So I would recommend either downloading pypet from github
and run the tests in your IDE.
Or you still might want to wait for some time for the official 0.1.0
release because I am trying to work around that in the meantime.
