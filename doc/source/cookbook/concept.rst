More on the conceptual ideas
=============================

This project was born out of the need for a tool to manage and store results of spiking neural
network simulations. In particular to manage results obtained with the BRIAN_ neural network
simulator.
The more complex simulations become the more complicated are the sets of parameters
and the harder it gets to qualitatively compare results obtained from different
simulation runs. There was a huge need to standardize the simulations and parameter
exploration to some extend.

So here come some co
