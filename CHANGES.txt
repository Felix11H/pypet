pypet 0.1b.1

*   Support for `long` types

*   Documentation for the `f_find_idx` function

*   The parameters `trajectory_name` and `trajectory_index` in f_load have been renamed to
    `name` and `index`

pypet 0.1b.0

*   Group nodes support __getitem__

*   SparseResult

*   If you merge trajectory, all environment settings of both are kept.

*   More information about the environment is added to the trajectory

*   BUG FIX:

    Recall of trajectory comments from diks yielded numpy strings instead of python strings
    This could cause trouble if the comment is empty!

*   Git Integration, you can now make autocommits for every experiment

*   New Sparse Parameter, for scipy sparse matrices

*   BUG FIX: Loading of Trajectory metadata, now v_time is loaded correctly

*   BUG FIX: Expand no longer repeats already run experiments

*   More fine grain overview tables

*   Comments for runs are only added once and not every run

*   The overview tables are now found in the group `overview`

*   Test are operating in a temp directory

*   Now you can have fast access with result if they contain only a single entry with the name of
    the result

*   New trajectory function `f_as_run` that makes the trajectory belief it is a particular
    single run and results and derived parameters of other runs are blinded out.

pypet 0.1a.6

*   BUG FIX: (HDF5StorageService): storing a trajectory several times increased run and info table

pypet 0.1a.5

*   Removed unnecessary imports
*   Better documentation

pypet 0.1a.4

*   Adding positional results will add them with the result name

pypet 0.1a.3

*   Better handling of filenames, now relative paths are considered

pypet 0.1a.2

*   Added automatic version grapping in setup.py


pypet 0.1a.1

*   BaseParameter supports now __getitem__ if it is an array
